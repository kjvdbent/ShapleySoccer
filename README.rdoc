== Premier League Research

This research project has two main objectives:
* to centralize data on English Premier League matches and players
* to build a successful model for predicting the outcome of games

Thus far, the project consists of scripts to pull data on teams, games, and players from the web and a simple linear regression model for assessing the impact players have on goal differential.
